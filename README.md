Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection plays a significant role in shaping the tumor microenvironment of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). However, the heterogeneity of cellular states and ecosystems within the tumor microenvironment of HPV-infected HNSCC is still largely unknown. Using the EcoTyper framework, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of human papillomavirus-associated cellular profiles and cellular ecotypes (CEs) landscapes in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Through single-cell transcriptomic profiling, 45 distinct cellular states across 12 major cell types were identified. The reproducibility of these states and ecotypes was validated across independent single-cell and bulk transcriptomic datasets. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed spatial correlation of cellular states from the same ecotype. Our results indicated that specific cellular states were linked to HPV infection and correlated with patient outcomes. HPV-positive individuals exhibited more pronounced immune responses compared to HPV-negative individuals. We found that HPV-positive enriched natural killer (NK) cell S02 cellular state is associated with improved survival outcomes. Conversely, the epithelial cell S05 state, which is more prevalent in HPV-negative patients, is considered a risk factor. The distribution of cellular states offered insights into clinical drug selection. Tumours enriched in NK-cell state S02 showed higher predicted sensitivity to JAK inhibitors in computational models.
